# Zelda Game (Ported to Python)

In this assignment I ported my Zelda game from javascript to Python. This is a 2D game which allows a 2D sprite (Zelda) to run around and run into flower pots or throw boomerangs at them. The biggest hurdle in this project was calculating collisions between link, walls, flower pots, and boomerangs. Any boomerang and flower pot contact causes flower pots to shatter and disappear. Any contant with link and a wall causes link to stop. And any contant with link and a flower pot causes the flower pot to slide around until it inevitably hits a wall and breaks.
